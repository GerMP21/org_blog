#+title: Probability Statistics Intro

* Probability and Statistics: An Introduction

** Introduction to Probability
   - Understanding the basics of probability theory
   - Probability distributions and their properties

** Combinatorics and Counting Principles
   - Counting methods, permutations, and combinations
   - Probability of events using combinatorial techniques

** Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem
   - Calculating conditional probabilities and applying Bayes' theorem
   - Applications in decision making and statistics

** Probability Distributions

*** 1. Discrete Distributions
    - Probability mass functions (PMFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)
    - Examples of discrete distributions (e.g., binomial, Poisson)

*** 2. Continuous Distributions
    - Probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)
    - Examples of continuous distributions (e.g., normal, exponential)

** Descriptive Statistics
   - Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and variability (variance, standard deviation)
   - Data visualization and summary statistics

** Inferential Statistics

*** 1. Estimation
    - Point estimation and interval estimation
    - Confidence intervals and margin of error

*** 2. Hypothesis Testing
    - Formulating and testing hypotheses
    - Types of errors and significance levels

** Regression and Correlation
   - Linear regression and correlation analysis
   - Interpreting regression coefficients and assessing model fit

** Probability and Statistics in Data Analysis
   - How probability and statistics concepts are applied in data science and analysis
   - Examples from hypothesis testing, A/B testing, and experimental design

** Probability and Statistics in Machine Learning
   - Applications of probability and statistics in machine learning algorithms
   - Examples from Bayesian methods, statistical learning, and more

** Further Reading and Resources
   - Recommended books, courses, and online resources for further learning in probability and statistics
